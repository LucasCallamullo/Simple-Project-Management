## Description [EN]
This project is part of the final practical assignment for the subject "Algorithms and Data Structures" in the Systems Engineering program at the National Technological University.

The main objective is to map "Envio" (Shipment) type objects by defining the Envio class, along with its attributes and corresponding methods. Shipment data is retrieved from a .csv file, which is processed to extract and organize the information. This information is then stored in a binary file that serves as a database. From this database, various queries can be made using a menu of options.

### üìùüíª Applied Logic
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Design and organization of code through classes and objects.
- Mapping objects from a CSV file: Conversion of data from the CSV file into objects of the Envio class.
- Use and creation of binary files as a database: Efficient storage of mapped objects in a binary file that serves as a database.
- Queries on the binary file: Implementation of a search system that allows querying the stored data.
- Sequential searches: Exploring the data one by one to locate elements.
- Binary searches: Optimizing queries by implementing binary search algorithms.
- Use of Arrays: Implementation of matrix data structures to organize and process information.
- Generation of arrays from the binary file: Creation of data structures that are extracted and processed from the binary database.
- Use of sorting algorithms like Binary Insertion Sort or Shellsort: To optimize sorting by postal code when creating an array from the file.
